New world, new me.
New goals, new plans.
New mind, new peace.
New focus, new interest.

I've been having a hard time tryong to find myself in what I want to do. With enough unfortunate tire bursting potholes the year has run the world through, I see light at the end of the dark tunnel. I think I've found something that has filled all the above. CODING. All one student needs is direction, especially, in his youth. I understand the goal just need help finding my yellow brick road. I've always had a mentality of progression and consistent in finding oppurtunities. Now I intergrated these skills with my ability to adapt and think outside of the box I was born in.
